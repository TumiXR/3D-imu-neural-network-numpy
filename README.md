# 3D-imu-neural-network-numpy
Hello! This is a neural network I built during high school. It was implemented from scratch using only NumPy, without deep learning frameworks. The model is trained on motion sensor (IMU) data from wearable devices such as smartwatches and classifies 7 different types of movement (e.g., running). The goal is to adapt this for VR gloves and headset.
